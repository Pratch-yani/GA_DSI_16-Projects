# Data Science Immersive Projects @ General Assembly

This is a repository of the projects I've completed during the Data Science Immersive Course with General Assembly (July - Oct 2020)


## Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

This project is a subset of the data science process, focusing on framing the problem statement, analyzing of the data, and providing recommendations.  It covers:
- Statistics (distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)
- Python programming concepts
- Data Visualizations
- Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project 2: House Price Predictions based on Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

This project focuses on building and iteratively refining regression models to predict house prices.  It covers:
- Exceptionally detailed and robust dataset, based on The Ames Housing Dataset with over 70 different features relating to houses.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering is a crucial part of this project.
- Iteratively refining the model with regularization techniques and tuning hyperparameters to achieve the final model.  
- This is a Kaggle challenge and the models are submitted on unseen data.  
- Provide business insights to answer the problem statement.

## Project 3: NLP and Text Classification based on Reddit posts

This project explores various classification models for text classification.  It covers:
- Identifing a problem statement for NLP/Text Classification
- Selecting source of data (subreddits) and using API's to collect data
- Text data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis
- Explore and evaluate various classification models (Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest)
- Provide conclusions and recommendations to address the problem statment
