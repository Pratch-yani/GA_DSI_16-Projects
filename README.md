# Data Science Immersive Projects @ General Assembly

This is a repository of the projects I've completed during the Data Science Immersive Course with General Assembly (July - Oct 2020)


## Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

This project is a subset of the data science process, focusing on framing the problem statement, analyzing of the data, and providing recommendations.  It covers:

- Statistics (distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)
- Python programming concepts
- Data Visualizations
- Exploratory Data Analysis


## Project 2: House Price Predictions based on Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

This project focuses on building and iteratively refining regression models to predict house prices.  It covers:

- Exceptionally detailed and robust dataset, based on The Ames Housing Dataset with over 70 different features relating to houses.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering is a crucial part of this project.
- Iteratively refining the model with regularization techniques and tuning hyperparameters to achieve the final model.  
- This is a Kaggle challenge and the models are submitted on unseen data.  
- Provide business insights to answer the problem statement.


## Project 3: NLP and Text Classification based on Reddit posts

This is a text classification project based on Reddit platform.  I have chosen 2 subreddits (r/alexa and r/googlehome) and explores various classification models to classify the selftexts, and draw insights from discussions in the 2 groups.  The project covers:

- Identifing a problem statement for NLP/Text Classification
- Selecting source of data (subreddits from Reddit) and using API's to collect data
- Text data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (including wordcloud)
- Explore and evaluate various classification models (Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest)
- Provide conclusions and recommendations to address the problem statment


## Project 4: West Nile Virus Prediction

This is a group project that I worked with 2 other teammates from the same cohort (Esther Leung and Wayne Chiang).  Based on a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus), we are tasked to predict the presence of West Nile Virus in the mosquitos in Chicago, Illinois, conduct cost analysis and provide recommendations to the CDC.  Key tasks includes:

- Data cleaning/wrangling with 4 datasets (train/test mosquito trap data, weather data, spraying data)
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
- Develop stategies to handle imbalanced data
- Explore and evaluate various classification models (Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost)
- Conduct cost-benefit analysis with different options combat West Nile Virus.
- Provide conclusions and recommendations
